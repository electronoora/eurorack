A 6HP eurorack module for switching between two input signals and muting/unmuting the output of the signal. The module consists of three channels that operate independently of
each other. Input switching and muting/unmuting actions can be staged to happen concurrently on multiple channels, and committed either manually with a button press or automatically
by a trigger/gate signal.
