Here are the schematics and Gerber fabrication files for all PCBs needed to build a module.

Note that the height of the caps on TL1265 switches is not sufficient to clear the top surface of the front panel since the Thonkiconns require 11mm of minimum clearance between the front panel and the control board. 

To raise the switches, you'll need seven 1.6mm tall spacers to install between the switch and the control board PCB. Since this is the typical thickness of a PCB, you can fabricate small pieces of PCB to place under the switches.
If you have access to a 3D printer, you can alternatively also print plastic spacers to perform the same task. Under the folder `Switch spacers` you can find both the Gerber files to manufacture the PCBs, as well as the .stl files
to print ones yourself.
